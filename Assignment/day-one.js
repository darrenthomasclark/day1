// 1. Assign the message "Hello, World!" to a variable.
let x = 'Hello, World!'

// 2. Assign a different string to a different variable.
let y = 'You are such a big place!'

// 3. Assign a number to a variable.
let z = 5;

// 4. Use string concatenation to display the number from #3 in a string.
console.log (z + y)

The result should look like this, right? 5You are such a big place!


// 5. Make an array of at least four of your favorite movies or books or bands.
const bands = [Maserati, The Mercury Program, Mogwai, Mouse on the Keys];

// 6. Make an object of information about yourself with at least four properties.
const darren = {sex:"male", height:"76", color:"white" eyes:"blue"};

// 7. Make an array of objects containing more information about your favorite movies. The objects should have at least three properties.

// 8. Use `for` to loop through the answer from exercise #7 and print only one property from the object. i.e., given `{ title: "Gone with the Wind" }` you print "Gone with the Wind".
